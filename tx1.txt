Building a maze-solving robot using an Arduino involves several steps, including hardware setup and programming. Here's a high-level overview of the process along with sample code for your reference:

Hardware Setup:
1. Gather the necessary components:
   - Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
   - Motor driver (e.g., L298N)
   - DC motors (usually two-wheel drive)
   - Ultrasonic sensor (e.g., HC-SR04)
   - Breadboard and jumper wires
   - Battery pack or power supply
   - Chassis for the robot (e.g., a car or tank-like structure)

2. Connect the hardware components:
   - Connect the motor driver to the Arduino following the datasheet instructions.
   - Connect the motors to the motor driver outputs.
   - Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino's digital pins.
   - Connect the power supply/battery pack to the motor driver and Arduino.

Software Programming:
3. Install the Arduino IDE and set up the board:
   - Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official Arduino website.
   - Connect your Arduino board to your computer via USB.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and select the appropriate board and port from the "Tools" menu.

4. Write the code for maze solving:
   Here's a sample code to get you started. It uses the ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and DC motors to control the movement of the robot.

```cpp
// Define motor pins
const int motor1Pin1 = 2;
const int motor1Pin2 = 3;
const int motor2Pin1 = 4;
const int motor2Pin2 = 5;

// Define ultrasonic sensor pins
const int trigPin = 6;
const int echoPin = 7;

// Define maze-solving algorithm parameters
const int mazeThreshold = 20;  // Distance threshold for obstacle detection
const int baseSpeed = 150;     // Base motor speed
const int turnDelay = 500;     // Delay for turning (in milliseconds)

void setup() {
  // Initialize motor pins as outputs
  pinMode(motor1Pin1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motor1Pin2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motor2Pin1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motor2Pin2, OUTPUT);

  // Initialize ultrasonic sensor pins
  pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Measure distance using ultrasonic sensor
  long duration, distance;
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(2);
  digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
  distance = duration * 0.034 / 2;

  // Check for obstacles
  if (distance > mazeThreshold) {
    // No obstacle detected, move forward
    moveForward();
  } else {
    // Obstacle detected, turn right
    turnRight();
    delay(turnDelay);
  }
}

void moveForward() {
  // Set motor directions for forward movement
  digitalWrite(motor1Pin1, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(motor1Pin2, LOW);
  digitalWrite(motor2Pin1, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(motor2Pin2, LOW);

  // Set motor speeds
  analogWrite(motor1Pin2, baseSpeed);
  analogWrite(motor2Pin2, baseSpeed);
}

void turnRight() {
  // Set motor directions for right turn
  digitalWrite(motor1Pin1, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(motor1Pin2, LOW);
  digitalWrite(motor2Pin1, LOW);
  digitalWrite(motor2Pin2, HIGH);

  //

 Set motor speeds for turning
  analogWrite(motor1Pin2, baseSpeed);
  analogWrite(motor2Pin2, baseSpeed);
}
```

5. Upload the code to the Arduino:
   - Connect your Arduino board to your computer via USB.
   - Click the "Upload" button in the Arduino IDE.
   - The IDE will compile the code and upload it to the Arduino.

Once the code is uploaded, your maze-solving robot should start moving forward until it detects an obstacle. When an obstacle is detected, it will turn right and continue exploring the maze. Make sure to adjust the parameters and motor connections according to your specific hardware setup.

Please note that this is a basic example to get you started, and you may need to enhance the code or add additional sensors/functionalities depending on the complexity of the maze-solving task.Building a maze-solving robot using an Arduino involves several steps, including hardware setup and programming.
